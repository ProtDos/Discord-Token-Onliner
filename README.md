## Warning
This didn't get patched at this moment: `8/16/2022`. If it did, please make an issue. Feel free to fork it and make pull requests. 
Your tokens won't get banned from discord at this time. 
This is no self bot, so it's NOT illigal to use. I still don't take any responsabilities for any damage. 
It's your choice to download and use the script. 
> I'm not a 12 y/o token scammer, feel free to look into the code.
