## Warning
This didn't get patched at this moment: 8/16/2022. If it did, please make an isuue. Feel free to fork it and make pull requests. 
Your tokens won't get banned from discord at this time. 
This is no self bot, so it's NOT illigal to use. I still don't take any responsabilities for any damage.
