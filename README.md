Don't get confused about this. It's current bug, I'll fix it asap. The bot still works. 

## Features
- unlimited tokens
- locked tokens work
- tokens won't get banned
- fast
- personal

## Error Mode
If you get any errors try running `error_main.py`. If it doesn't help either, please make an [issue](https://github.com/ProtDos/Discord-Token-Onliner/issues/new) or contact me.


## Random mode
If you set `random=True`, the random mode will be enabled. It'll will look like this:

Else you can specify the status and text by your own.

## Warning
This didn't get patched at this moment: `8/16/2022`. If it did, please make an issue. Feel free to fork it and make pull requests. 
Your tokens won't get banned from discord at this time. 
This is no self bot, so it's NOT illigal to use. I still don't take any responsabilities for any damage. 
It's your choice to download and use the script. 
> I'm not a 12 y/o token scammer, feel free to look into the code.

## Enjoy!
